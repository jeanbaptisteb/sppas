    The creation of text corpora requires a sequence of processing steps in
    order to constitute, normalize, and then to directly exploit it by a given
    application. This package implements a generic approach for text
    normalization that can be applied on a multipurpose multilingual text or
    transcribed corpus.
    It consists in splitting the text normalization problem in a set of minor
    sub-problems as language-independent as possible. The portability to a new
    language consists of heritage of all language independent methods and
    rapid adaptation of other language dependent methods or classes.
